I am a music lover who has found an equal love for programming.  One of the first programs I made automated the tedious process of converting and updating my iTunes playlists into their Traktor counterparts.  Since then I have learned much more in Object Oriented Design and good coding practices.  Immediately upon finishing my studies at Maker's Academy in London, I began work on a music app for sharing the air-space at parties (<a href="http://musicdrop.me">MusicDrop.me</a>).  When I realized the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-ioshtml5/">restrictions of HTML5 Audio pre-loading in mobile devices</a>, I stopped development to begin focusing on developing native apps.  Now I am studying Objective-C to get a good base from which to build solid iOS and OSX applications. --- I would like to continue on this path of learning and ultimately make my own products.


## Skills

### Web Development

#### Node & AngularJS

I started learning Node towards the end of my time at Makers, and coming from Sinatra at first I did not like it.  However now I use
Node almost exclusively for my web applications, and have grown quite fond of it.  Equally appealing to me has been the Angular.js framework. I love the responsiveness one can achieve, especially in applications that deal with web sockets.

My first experience with Node/Angular came while working on a group project called <a href="https://github.com/BeerPromise/beer-promise">Beer Promise</a> <i>(later renamed 'Golden Ticket')</i>, an application to ease the pain of ordering a drink at a crowded bar.

Then after some small projects, I undertook my idea of creating a music server that would receive songs from guests at a party and play them in a fair order.  This became <a href="https://github.com/ErikAGriffin/music-server">Music Drop</a>, but as I mentioned above I stopped development to focus on a native solution.

#### Sinatra (hobbit)

Sinatra was my first exposure to a web-server framework, and after a short <a href="https://github.com/ErikAGriffin/rps-challenge">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a> challenge I began work on a <a href="https://github.com/ErikAGriffin/web-battleship">BattleShip</a> web game, which used a Ruby back-end that I had previously developed.  This was at the very earliest stages of my web-development when I had just been introduced to Javascript, had barely touched JQuery, and never even heard of Angular.

I mention hobbit above, because that is the framework I actually prefer to use when developing in Ruby.  It is essentially the exact same as Sinatra <i>(especially with my <a href="https://github.com/ErikAGriffin/hobbit-hole">hobbit-hole<a/> gem)</i>, only one tenth the size and <a href="https://github.com/luislavena/bench-micro">much quicker</a>.  Aside from some additional setup, any developer who has used Sinatra would be able to switch to hobbit and not even notice the difference.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (Feb - Apr 2015)

Prior coming to Makers in February, I was attempting to teach myself Objective-C programming through mostly trial and error + Google. Looking back now at the code I wrote then was quite astonishing.  I had never heard of version control or test driven development, and that includes my studies in Computer Science at university.  I did have a fairly solid grasp on the concepts of Object Oriented Programming and other abstract concepts, but not how to properly implement them.  However this background allowed me to soak up an incredible amount of information from each lecture without struggling on any individual concept.

We initially began coding simple command-line Ruby applications and quickly began to incorporate OOP and TDD in our challenges.
On the first or second day a challenge was thrown out to see who could create the shortest Ruby implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar cipher</a>. I managed to get each method <a href="https://github.com/ErikAGriffin/caesar-cypher">down to 2 lines.</a>  Later, out of curiosity, I wanted to implement the Vigner√© cipher in Ruby, and the result of that endeavor can <a href="https://github.com/ErikAGriffin/vigenere/blob/master/lib/vigenere_cipher.rb">be seen here.</a>


#### University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (2010 - 2014)

- B.A. in Psychology
- Minor in Computer Science

In college I had a great interest in film as well as the study of the mind.  After spending some time figuring out what I wanted to do,
I settled on picking up Computer Science and managed to fit it in as a minor.  My favorite course from this discipline by far was Computer Networking, a top-down approach of how the internet is put together. We dealt with everything from internet protocols to the different kinds of mediums used to transmit data across the globe.  In fact I really recommend the text book from this course to anyone interested in learning more about the nuts and bolts of the Internet: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-Edition/dp/0132856204">Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach</a>.
During the course we built an SMTP Mail Server in Java.

I also studied basic logic, circuit components & hardware, assembly language, data-strucutes, and algorithms.
